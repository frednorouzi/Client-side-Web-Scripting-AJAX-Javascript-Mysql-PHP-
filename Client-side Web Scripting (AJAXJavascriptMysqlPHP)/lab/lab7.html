<p>The first link should open a small window that goes to Yahoo. The second link should
open up Google in the same yahoo window. There should only ever be 1 popup 
window (the content in the popup window will be replaced when
you click each link). The popup window should be FOCUSED forward when a link is clicked.
 There are problems with the JS file, but you may also need to modify this HTML file to 
get it to work.</p>

<p>Suggestions: use your debugger. It is easier to use this in Firefox -- run the 
script and hit CONTROL-SHIFT-J to open the console. Also consider putting ALERTS in your 
script to see if things are even running. If you put an alert() in the first line of a 
function and it never runs, that indicates that the function didn't run at all -- so
 go see if something is wrong with the event that called the function.</p>
